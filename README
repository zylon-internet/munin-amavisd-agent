Amavisd-agent plugin for munin

Why?
Other plugins parse logs in an ugly way.
Amavis now has infrastructure for this with an agent that gets it for you.

How?
# cat > /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/amavisd-agent << FOO
[amavisd-agent]
   user amavis
FOO

Then put this in your munin plugin path and autoconf.
